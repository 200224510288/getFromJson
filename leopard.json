    "descriptionHabitatLoss": "More than any environmental factor, however, anthropogenic activity threatens the sectionerse ecosystems of Sri Lanka. Humans encroach into or destroy the habitats of countless species through pollution, infrastructural development, agriculture, industry, and unsustainable tourism. Wherever humans clear forests, build roads, and expand plantations without careful consideration, some part of the ecosystem is destroyed.In some cases, the degradation, fragmentation or outright loss of habitats leads to open human-animal conflict: elephants raid paddy fields or trample villages while leopards are lynched by enraged townsfolk. Other species die more quiet deaths, like the tree frogs or the freshwater crabs threatened by extinction from habitat loss and industrial pollution.",
